        <p>Dear,</p>

            I have 5+ years of experience coaching at the Local Cricket League, helping young players develop their skills and game awareness. Throughout my coaching career, I have focused on fostering teamwork, enhancing player technique, and implementing modern training strategies. My previous role in the City Youth League has also given me the opportunity to work with talented youth teams, refining their skills and preparing them for competitive matches.

        <p>Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
